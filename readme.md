# Halbot (Hal 9.1k)
Halbot is active on the [WDD Slack channel](https://wdd.slack.com/). He&rsquo;s built using the [Node Slack client](https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-client). Since Hal 9000 [had a few bugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MMmYyIZlC4), he was rendered de-operational, upgraded, and versioned Hal 9.1k. We&rsquo;re sure that this is a good idea.

## Contributing
You may find &ldquo;[Contributing to Open Source on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/)&rdquo; to be helpful if this is one of your first open source contributions. This repository is using the &ldquo;Fork & Pull&rdquo; developmental model. From GitHub:
>The fork & pull model lets anyone fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork without requiring access be granted to the source repository. The changes must then be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer. This model reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and is popular with open source projects because it allows people to work independently without upfront coordination.

In short, you&rsquo;ll have to:
* [fork the repo and configure your fork to sync upstream](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
* [create a branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) for your feature (_remember, always [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) before you begin_)
* epically improve Halbot (though we&rsquo;d advise against teaching him to read lips)
* [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

## Current Features
As a HAL (Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer), Hal 9.1k will soon add his own features. Until then, Hal:
* has Cleverbot integration through the [Cleverbot.io module](https://github.com/CleverbotIO/node-cleverbot.io).
* can recall the history of a channel
